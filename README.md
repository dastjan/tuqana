# Tuqana

With the Tuqana project we built the Telegram-based 'GiulioPortfolioBot' that includes the following functionalities:

1. Custom price alerts;
2. Insider trading alerts;
3. Discounted cash flow analysis;
4. Discriptive statistics;
5. Press release alerts;
6. Alerts when intraday price deviates 1.5 times standarddeviation from the average;
7. Alerts when intraday volume deviates 1.5 times standarddeviation from the average;
8. Settings menu where you can set your preferences.

## Usage

Access the bot via this [link](https://t.me/GiulioPortfolioBot) or search and try to find the ```GiulioPortfolioBot``` on Telegram! You can now interact with the bot!

## Availability

Currently, we're keeping a server and a database live to maintain functionality of the bot. As some of our code contains keys for databases we decided to make the functionalities of the bot seperately available.

## Contributing
Feedback, suggestions or requests for improvements are much appreciated!
