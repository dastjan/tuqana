# Tuqana

With the Tuqana project we built the Telegram-based ```GiulioPortfolioBot``` that includes the following functionalities:

#### Alerts (Configurable)

* Custom price alerts;
* Insider trading alerts;
* Press release alerts;
* Alerts when intraday price deviates 1.5 standarddeviation from the average;
* Alerts when intraday volume deviates 1.5 standarddeviation from the average.

#### Analysis

* Discounted cash flow analysis;
* Discriptive statistics analysis;
* Markowitz portfolio analysis.


## Usage

Access the bot via this [link](https://t.me/GiulioPortfolioBot) or search and try to find the ```GiulioPortfolioBot``` on Telegram. You can now interact with the bot!

## Availability

Currently, we're keeping a server and a database live to maintain functionality of the bot. As some of our code contains keys for databases we decided to make the functionalities of the bot seperately available.

Feedback, suggestions or requests for improvements are much appreciated!
